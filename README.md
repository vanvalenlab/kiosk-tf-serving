`kiosk-tf-serving` uses [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving) to serve deep learning models over gRPC and REST APIs. A configuration file can be automatically created using `python write_config_file.py` to allow any model found in a (AWS or GCS) storage bucket to be served.

TensorFlow serving will host all versions of all models in the bucket via RPC and REST APIs.

This repository is part of the [DeepCell Kiosk](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-console). More information about the Kiosk project is available through [Read the Docs](https://deepcell-kiosk.readthedocs.io/en/master) and our [FAQ](http://www.deepcell.org/faq) page.

## Docker

Build the docker image by running

```bash
docker build --pull -t $(whoami)/kiosk-tf-serving -f docker/Dockerfile.server .
```

Run the docker image by running

```bash
# write the configuration files for a given bucket
python write_config_model.py --storage-bucket=$STORAGE_BUCKET

# mount the config files and run the image
docker run --gpus=1 -it \
    -v $PWD:/config \
    -e PORT=8500 \
    -e REST_API_PORT=8501 \
    -p 8500:8500 \
    -p 8501:8501 \
    $(whoami)/kiosk-tf-serving:latest
```

## Configuration

The `kiosk-tf-serving` can be configured using environmental variables in a `.env` file.

| `STORAGE_BUCKET` | **REQUIRED**: Cloud storage bucket address (e.g. `"gs://bucket-name"`). | `""` |
| `PORT` | Port to listen on for gRPC API. | `8500` |
| `REST_API_PORT` | Port to listen on for HTTP/REST API. | `8501` |
| `REST_API_TIMEOUT` | Timeout in ms for HTTP/REST API calls. | `30000` |
