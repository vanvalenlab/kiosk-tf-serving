`kiosk-tf-serving` uses [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving) to serve deep learning models over gRPC API and REST API. A configuration file is automatically created on startup which allows any model found in a (AWS or GCS) storage bucket to be served.

TensorFlow serving will host all versions of all models in the bucket via RPC API and REST API.

This repository is part of the [DeepCell Kiosk](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk). More information about the Kiosk project is available through [Read the Docs](https://deepcell-kiosk.readthedocs.io/en/master) and our [FAQ](http://www.deepcell.org.faq) page.
